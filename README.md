The purpose of this repo is to code along with routing section in "The Complete Angular Guide" on Udemy.
The first commit was simply what I extracted from the original zip file. 
Everything afterwards is me coding along with the tutorial.
Note that the point of this app is to demonstrate routing capabilities in Angular, not actually building a complete app.
